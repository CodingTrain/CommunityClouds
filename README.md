## About Processing Community Day

> Community Day will bring together members of the community to discuss work,
> share ideas and experiences, and promote outreach to new members,
> particularly those who are underrepresented in creative and technological
> fields. The event is a time to celebrate, reflect, and look forward.

> Organized by the Processing Foundation, the day-long event is for anyone
> interested in creative computing, software literacy, accessibility, and
> diversity in the fields of art, technology, and design. The event will be a
> mix of talks and demos by people from all backgrounds within the Processing
> community, as well as the Processing Foundation members, Fellows, and others
> who use Processing, p5.js, and all the related variants in their work.

## Contributing

The main theme is, of course, the community and so it would be great if you
want to submit functions to generate cloud shapes! If you are new to git, you
can check out [Git and GitHub for Poets][2], otherwise feel free to fork this
repository and create a Pull Request with your changes. Need help? Feel free
to raise an issue if there's anything we can help you with!

To add a new cloud generator, simply edit the `generators.js` file and create
a new function following the example! Your new generator should then show up
in the list on the main page!

### What are we looking for?

Anything really! Perhaps you have a design in your mind,
or perhaps you can take inspiration from this cloud drawing from Processing Day organizer Taeyoon Choi:
